LiPo-Booster
============
A breadboard-friendly boost converter board based on TPS61230 from Texus Instrument. The input voltage from a single cell LiPo battery is converted to 5V for use with 5V systems.

v1: Minimum component count

v2: Configurable UVLO using three additional resistors

Please refer to the TPS61230 datasheet for UVLO resistors calculation.
